# TODO

- Redesign in the style of Hoplite
	- Each level fits on the screen (ideally)
	- You're placed somewhere on the level
	- Enemies are scattered around the level and can all see you
	- You either have to reach a staircase or kill all enemies
	- After each level, you can upgrade or heal
- More enemies
	- Ranged
	- Only damaged by a certain numbered attack (but slow)
	- Diagonal movement (but slow)
	- Multiple HP
		- Knocked back and/or stunned upon taking damage
	- Flying enemies and chasms
- Upgrades
	- Per-side damage increases
	- Per-side range increases
	- Health increases
- UX
	- Softlock detection: show R to restart when no moves are possible
	- Hold down direction to move automatically
	- Mouse movement
	- Show attack areas as icons on bottom of screen
	- Title screen
	- Game over screen
	- Options menu
