# TODO

- Redesign in the style of Hoplite
	- Each level fits on the screen (ideally)
	- You're placed somewhere on the level
	- Enemies are scattered around the level and can all see you
	- You either have to reach a staircase or kill all enemies
	- After each level, you can upgrade or heal
- More enemies
	- Ranged
	- Only damaged by a certain numbered attack (but slow)
	- Diagonal movement (but slow)
	- Multiple HP
		- Knocked back and/or stunned upon taking damage
	- Flying enemies and chasms
	- Enemies with delayed/AoE attacks that can damage other enemies
- Level elements
	- Doors that you can open by moving into them
	- Barricades that be destroyed by attacking them
	- Hazards that deal damage if you attack them
	- Gates that can only be passed through with a certain face
	- Basic positional traps (spikes, linear arrow/flame traps)
- Upgrades
	- Per-side damage increases
	- Per-side range increases
	- Health increases
- UX
	- Hold down direction to move automatically
	- Mouse movement
	- Show attack areas as icons on bottom of screen
	- Menus
		- Main menu
		- Game over
		- Credits
		- Options
			- Music
			- Sound
			- Screen shake
			- Particles
			- Fullscreen
	- Speedrun timer
- Graphics
	- Autotiled walls
	- Aesthetic tiles
		- Torches
		- Bones
		- Debris
	- Vignette?
- Refactoring
	- Extract functions to their relevant nodes
		- Attack animations to Attacks
		- Move drawing to MoveMap
		- Health drawing to HealthMap
	- Use signals to decouple code
	- Separate attack sound from enemy death sound (in the case of multi-HP enemies)

Notes and ideas:

- Being surrounded by enemies is more fun than fighting them in single file; the Hoplite idea addresses this
- Destroying multiple enemies in one move is satisfying; try to encourage this
