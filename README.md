# Die Krypta

Roll yourself through the crypt and attack with each of your faces.
Made in under 12 hours for the [2022 GMTK Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-jam-2022).

> In a life long past, you were cursed by Die Hexe, a malevolent conjurer of geometric transformation.
> With your spirit imprisoned within a crystalline prism, you were left to wander the earth forever in silence...
> 
> But finally, after countless years, you have come upon the haunted tomb of that foul sorcerer who wronged you so long ago.
> You know that in its final stone chamber lies Die Tasse, a cup bearing the elixir that shall restore your mortal form.
> 
> The ancient magicks of this place have awakened a spark within you, now igniting each face of your hexahedral form with the power to smite the wraiths and specters that still lurk within.
> But move wisely, for each face bears a different mark, and you must align them with your foes lest they rend the last vestiges of your soul.
> So roll forth, brave cubic wanderer, and enter...
> Die Krypta!

## How to Play

With each move, you roll to a new face of the die.
The face you will turn up is displayed in each direction.
Each face has a different attack, highlighted in red after you move.

### Controls

- Space/Period: Wait
- R: Restart

### Attacks

Most attacks resemble the arrangement of pips on the die.
Below, the specific cells you attack when the given face is turned up are marked with X's.
1 is special in that it attacks forward in the direction you just moved.
