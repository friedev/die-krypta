# Die Krypta

A turn-based dungeon puzzler where you play as a die.

> In a life long past, you were cursed by Die Hexe, a malevolent conjurer of geometric transformation.
> With your spirit imprisoned within a crystalline prism, you were left to wander the earth forever in silence...
> 
> But finally, after countless years, you have come upon the haunted tomb of that foul sorcerer who wronged you so long ago.
> You know that in its final stone chamber lies Die Tasse, a cup bearing the elixir that shall restore your mortal form.
> 
> The ancient magicks of this place have awakened a spark within you, now igniting each face of your hexahedral form with the power to smite the wraiths and specters that still lurk within.
> But move wisely, for each face bears a different mark, and you must align them with your foes lest they rend the last vestiges of your soul.
> So roll forth, brave cubic wanderer, and enter...
> Die Krypta!

## How to Play

Each move you make rolls you to a new face of the die.
Each pip on that face represents an attack in the corresponding direction.
The central pip is special in that it attacks in the same direction that you move.

Currently, your goal is to delve as deep into the crypt as you can.
To clear a floor, you'll need to defeat every enemy on it.
Hover your cursor over enemies and traps for more information about them.
